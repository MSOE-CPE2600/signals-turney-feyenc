Signal Disposition:
    the type of action preformed upon recieving the signal

A signal handler is a function that is called upon recieving a signal.
It is used to recieving communications from other processes

Signal Dispositions:
    - default - preforms the default action
    - ignored - does nothing
    - handled - preforms the action in a signal handler
    - terminate - cancels the program
    - core dump - terminates but also creates a log of the current memory state

The kill function can send a signal to another process:
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid > 0) {
        kill(SIGINT, pid);
        sleep(1);
    } else {
        sleep(3);
        puts("will never print, will be SIGINTed first");
    }

Ctrl-C sends a SIGINT to the forground process

SIGINT:
    kills the process (also is Ctrl-C)
    terminates
    can be overridden

SIGTERM:
    requests a process to terminate
    terminates by default
    can be overridden to allow for graceful shutdown

SIGUSR1:
    does nothing unless defined
    terminates by default
    can be overridden for custom actions

SIGKILL:
    Always kills a process
    terminates
    cannot be overridden (allows you to always have a way to terminate a process)

SIGSTOP:
    stops a process
    handled
    cannot be overridden (allows you to always have a way to pause a process)
